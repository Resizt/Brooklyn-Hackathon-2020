			It is easy to take for granted what is thought to be invariable. The reality for some however, is homelessness. For some finding a place to eat, a place to bathe or get medical treatment is quite challenging. The website we created is a resource for individuals in need of said assistance. It is an easy to navigate map of NYC that is tailored at locating facilities necessary for people with no access to basic human needs. Homelessness is a problem in every metropolis, and with the skyrocketing number coronavirus patients in New York the homeless tend to have a higher risk of infection due to having no access to basic preventative measures like hand soap and running water. Such facilities must be easily accessible to those in need. Click the Icon above to find the help you require.
